					<ul>
						<li>
							<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> Wayfair uses multiples of 8, for padding meaning that they are not guessing how much padding to add. This is good thing to learn because for my personal project I just guess how much whitespace to add. By having a consistent system my websites can be more consistent </p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> My Favorite part of the articles was the examples it give. It helps reinforce the narrative and explain concepts. It is also a good reference for when I am designing my own websites</p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>Copy and paste a quote you found compelling, interesting, or cool</p>
